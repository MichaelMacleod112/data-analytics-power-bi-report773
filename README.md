# Data analytics - Power BI Report

Project containing files necessary to produce a comprehensive report in Power BI for AI core course 2023, using dummy order, customer, store and product data. 

## Usage
As currently planned, the report will be self standing and no external files or scripts will need to be run. Opening the "report.pbix" file in Power BI should be all that is needed to view the contents of this report,  unless it is exported to a more user friendly format at t alata date.

Checking data files have been successfully imported:
- Local files: these should be downloaded with the rest of the project as cloned from github, however Power BI may require some paths to be edited to reflect the absolute location of files on your machine. Possibly something to work on.
- Server credentials should be saved and import successfully, if they dont then god help you

## File Contents

- report.pbix
 - /data/ - contains local data files which make up part of the data used for analysis. 
 List them here...
 - product_script.py - very short script to extract and convert numeric values for weight which are initially stored in g, kg and ml. This script does not need to be run.
